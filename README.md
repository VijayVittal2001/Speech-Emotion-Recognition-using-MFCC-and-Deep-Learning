# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-MFCC-and-Deep-Learning
This project implements a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using the RAVDESS dataset, which contains audio recordings of speech expressing eight emotions: neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, and surprised. The goal is to classify the emotional state of a speaker from short audio clips.
